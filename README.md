# TIC-TAC-TOE

Title: Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C 

Overview:

This C program implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, allowing two players to take turns and compete against each other. The game provides a simple command-line interface and keeps track of player moves and the game's progress.

Key Features:

Player Interaction: Players can take turns to make their moves by specifying the position they want to place their mark (X or O).

Winning Condition: The program checks for winning conditions after each move, and if a player succeeds in placing their marks in a winning pattern, they are declared the winner.

How to Play:

Players choose their marks: X or O.
Players take turns to enter the position where they want to place their mark.
The program checks for a winning condition after each move.
The game ends when one player wins or when there are no valid moves left, resulting in a draw.

Note: This is a console-based game, and players need to input their moves by entering a numeric position.
